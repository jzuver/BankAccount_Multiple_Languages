## Program Description
This program simulates a bank account. The user is first asked to create a username
and password. Once an account has been created, a list of banking options are displayed to the user.
The user is able to check the balances of both the checking and savings accounts, deposit, withdraw, and exit. Once the user is done and decides
to exit the banking program, the user's checking and savings accounts' balances are passed to a python program as 
command line arguments. The python program then creates a bar graph and pie chart using the command line arguments,
and displays the graph and chart to the user.

### Installation Instructions
This program uses C++ and Python. The program should work
as long as these languages are downloaded, installed, and the PATH variables are configured properly.
